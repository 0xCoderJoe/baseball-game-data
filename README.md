# Baseball Data

A Jupyter notebook style data provider that uses the PyBaseball library to grab game history. Then, cleans the data provided and results in a data set ready for writing queries against to generate statstics. 

The notebook is heavily explained and provides an example of a frequency analysis for games ending in the total amount of runs over the course of the season. The intent is to offer ideas to the analyst.

The real meat of the project should outline how one may use a combination of libraries, sources, and technologies to synthesize raw data into a usable data set for various projects.
